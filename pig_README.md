Game of Pig

Dice rolling game

Object of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points. The user is playing against the computer. Initially, the highest roll (or equal for human) determines who goes first.

The player rolls one die and gets points corresponding to the digits shown. If it is a 2-6, player may keep points and choose to roll again repeatedly, adding new values to previous score. If the player rolls a 1, all points collected on that turn go to zero and their turn ends. Player may opt to hold if a 1 has not been rolled, and keep all points, ending the players turn. Turns continue until the first player reaches at least 100 points, winning and ending the game.
